## About Subspace / Continuum
[Subspace Continuum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/352700/Subspace_Continuum/) is a 2D massive-multiplayer online game (MMOG) from the 90s that consists of a server and a client. Anyone can host their own Subspace Zone (server) and allow clients to connect to it.

## About Subspace Infinity
This is a cross-platform Subspace client and server written in Java. It was developed from scratch on the idea of extensibility and modularity. The server is based on modules/frameworks highly optimized for scaled, networked, grid-based physics. The client is based on the [JMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/), a minimalistic modern developer friendly game engine
